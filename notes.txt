double insert has  an unshift vs the doubleuppend has a .push.
unshift exponentially gets slower with larger array because it has a O(n)
time complexity... this is because everytime it sends a new number to the 
beginning of a new array it has to shift all the numbers. Whereas
the .push() method is o(1) which will be linear. thats because it still gets
slower with each array... but only linear because it just adds to the end and 
doesnt have to shift the whole array.
